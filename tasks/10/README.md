1. Install and create new project using [angular cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
2. Generate a component List.
3. Generate a service that will call this [api](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) and will get all posts (use [Angular Http service](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/server-communication.html#!#fetch-data))
4. Store all the posts in the service and create a method read that will take two arguments - offset, size (both numbers). Using RxJS operators ```take``` and ```skip``` this method should return the selected portion of posts. ([RxJs operators](https://github.com/ReactiveX/rxjs/tree/master/src/operator)).
5. Inject the service into your Component and use the get method to load some posts when the component is created. Check the Angular 2 [lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/lifecycle-hooks.html) or use the constructor to make the call to the service. Check Angular 2 [build-in directives](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/attribute-directives.html) and present the data in the view.
6. Create two buttons (get prev N posts, get next N posts, N is the pageSize) in the component template and hook them with the Component class. The idea is to create paging for our posts.
7. Create an input field and using RxJS create a listener for the keyup event. The idea is to create a search filter that will filter out posts and present them to the user dynamically.
